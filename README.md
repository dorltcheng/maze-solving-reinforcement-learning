# Reinforcement Learning

Projects done based on Reinforcement Learning course, Department of Computing, Imperial College London.

#### 1. Maze Solving by RL 
Applied three algorithms: 
- Dynamic Programming (value iteration)
- Monte-Carlo Learning (epsilon-greedy Control)
- Temporal Difference Learning (epsilon-greedy SARSA Control).
